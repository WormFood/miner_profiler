 The function of this program, is to run your GPU at various settings, and  
 record the output of bfgminer, so that you can compare different settings  
 to determine the best settings for your GPUs. While this program was
 written for bfgminer, it should be easily adapted to just about any other
 system.

 Command line options are as follows:                                       
 -i --intensity <start> [<stop> [<step> [<default>]]]                       
 -t --thread-concurrency <start> [<stop> [<step> [<default>]]]              
 -e --engine <start> [<stop> [<step> [<default>]]]                          
 -m --memory <start> [<stop> [<step> [<default>]]]                          
 -o --options <options to pass to the miner> (NOTE: MUST be last option     
 -c --config <config> path to configuration file to use for default values  
 -n --no-execute do a dry run, and don't actually execute anything          
 -l --limit <OCL card > limit testing to a single card                     
 -h --help                                                                  
 -M --minutes <runtime> how many minutes to run each test for               
 -g --gpu-count <gpu count> 0=autodetect number of GPUs to test             
 -E --miner-exe <bfgminer> path to bfgminer executable                      
 -a --after-test-config <config> path to configuration file to use, after   
                         all tests are complete. (don't want that GPU idle) 
 -u --underclock allow underclocked tests (where memory < engine)           
 -v --verbose use multiple times to increase the number of messages         
 -d --dry-run dont do anything, just show what would have been done         
 -s --skip-sanity-tests not implemented, but planned for in a future release

 start = setting to start at                                                
 stop = setting to stop at                                                  
 step = step size                                                           
 default = settings to use, when the number of tests to not exactly match   
           the number of GPUs. For example, if you have 3 GPUs, and you     
           4 tests, then the default will be used for the other 2 cards,    
           that are not part of the test. This option will NEVER be used    
           if you have only one GPU.
